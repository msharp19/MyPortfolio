                    <p>This is a Chrome Extension where a user can chat page to page, each chat room is actually based on the base URL of the site. Users can also rate the site he/she is commenting on and see what others have done too. The user can give MoC (credit version of ERC20 token) as tips to each other to help drive an incentive for adoption. Mo represents the worth of the network, initially pumped by a pre-sale providing incentive to growth and driving rich content.</p>
                    <p>This is an application of two parts, there is a Web API running in the background to serve html data and a JS script running on Chrome/Brave. This is in active development and is the third version of the UI.</p>
